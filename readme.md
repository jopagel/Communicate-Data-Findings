# Explore Bikesharing Data
## Johannes Pagel


## Dataset

The Ford GoBike System Dateset is a dateset that contains trip data from a bike service for public use. It consists of 239,111 entries and 14 features. These features include variables like, trip duration, start time and end time with date, start station and end station names, start and end coordinates, customer type, year of birth and gender.


## Summary of Findings

The following findings can be found in the exploration_template.ipynb file:

- The distribution of bookings during the course of the day is bimodal with it's peaks at 8/9 am and 5-7 pm. These are the typical hours of people getting to work and home
- The distribution of trip durations is right skewed and has it's maximum at 400 seconds
-  The counts of trips devided by dates show that users tend to drive more often on Wednesdays to Sundays than on Mondays and Tuesdays
- Subscribers book bikes significantly more often than normal customers
- The distribution of distance is right skewed with a Maximum of around 1000 meters
- There is a much higher variance in trip duration for basic Customers in comparison to Subscribers
- People tend to have longer and further trips  in the evening in comparison to the morning hours
- There seems to be a correlation between distance and duration of trips
- Subscribers tend to have a rather stable trip duration whereas customers show a higher variance in durations for given distances


## Key Insights for Presentation
The key insights for the presentation are the relationships between distance, duration and user-type. Thereby some of the plots of the exploration will be polished and used for a deeper analysis. Findings of this further investigation can be found in the slide_deck_template.ipynb file.
